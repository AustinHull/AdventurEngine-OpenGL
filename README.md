# AdventurEngine-OpenGL-SDK

Just working out the fun goodies of graphics programming from the various resources and guides avaiable to me.

Developed on Debian Linux, using CMake with gcc for building and compiling. Also using the typical group of API packages such as GLFW3, GLAD, glm, and stb_image for support.

Yes, it mostly just runs triangles/rectangles at the moment.
